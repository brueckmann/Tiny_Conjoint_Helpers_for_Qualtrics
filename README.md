# Tiny_Conjoint_Helpers_for_Qualtrics

## MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics
Based on only 3 inputs, the js MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics adds all embedded variables needed for a conjoint based on https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt to the qualtrics survey flow 
You only provide 3 inputs, the number of tasks (how many repetitions), number of profiles per task (often 2) and number of attributes used per task). The code is adapted from https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt/issues/5#issue-2146142409 

Much of the code can also be adapted for other uploads of embedded data to the Qualtrics survey flow.
