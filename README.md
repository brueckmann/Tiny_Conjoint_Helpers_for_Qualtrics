# Tiny_Conjoint_Helpers_for_Qualtrics

## MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics
Based on only 3 inputs, the js [MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics](https://github.com/brueckmann/Tiny_Conjoint_Helpers_for_Qualtrics/blob/main/MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics) adds all embedded variables needed for a conjoint based on [conjointsdt](https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt) by [@astrezhnev](https://github.com/astroboylrx) to the Qualtrics survey flow. 

You only provide 3 inputs, the number of tasks (how many repetitions), number of profiles per task (often 2) and number of attributes used per task). The code is influenced and adapted from a [comment](https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt/issues/5#issue-2146142409) by [@astroboylrx](https://github.com/astroboylrx).  

Much of the code can also be adapted for other uploads of embedded data to the Qualtrics survey flow.

It supports multiple languages, therefore, make sure to also include the code in all the translations.
