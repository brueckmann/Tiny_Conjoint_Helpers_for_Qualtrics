# Tiny_Conjoint_Helpers_for_Qualtrics

## MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics
Based on only 3 inputs, the js [MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics](https://github.com/brueckmann/Tiny_Conjoint_Helpers_for_Qualtrics/blob/main/MassEmbeddVariablesQualtrics) adds all embedded variables needed for a conjoint based on [conjointsdt](https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt) by [@astrezhnev](https://github.com/astroboylrx) to the Qualtrics survey flow. 

You only provide 3 inputs, the number of tasks (how many repetitions), number of profiles per task (often 2) and number of attributes used per task). The code is influenced and adapted from a [comment](https://github.com/astrezhnev/conjointsdt/issues/5#issue-2146142409) by [@astroboylrx](https://github.com/astroboylrx).  

Much of the code can also be adapted for other uploads of embedded data to the Qualtrics survey flow.
